# Noesis-Help

## Overview
Rich Whitehouse's Noesis is a powerful tool for model viewing and conversion. However, its official documentation is limited and can be difficult to navigate.

## What's Included
This repository provides:
- A complete list of Noesis functions (HTML and text formats)
- A list of advanced export commands
- A Python debug log script to generate documentation
- Mock `noesis` and `rapi` Python modules for IDE compatibility

## How to Use
1. **Debug Script**: Place the script in the Noesis Python folder to generate debug logs.
2. **Mock Modules**: Add the mock `noesis.py` and `rapi.py` modules to your plugin project to avoid import errors in your IDE.

## Compatibility
This documentation is based on Noesis version **4.474**.
