## Help Documentation for Rich Whitehouse's Noesis

Rich Whitehouse's Noesis is a powerful tool, but it comes with limited and somewhat challenging documentation. The existing documentation can be difficult to understand and does not cover all available functions.

Although I cannot upload files directly from Noesis, I can provide a complete list of functions. Additionally, I offer a debug log Python script. Place this script in the Noesis Python folder to generate debug logs.

This documentation is for Noesis version 4.474.
